        <h5>Definitions: Meeting Phase</h5>
        <p class="phaseDef"><span id="main-meeting-items" class="defTitle">Main Meeting Items</span><br/>
        This refers to anything that is not public comment or meeting opening/closing. It includes board discussions, board comments, votes, and presentations. It also includes presentations to recognize people/things and board member reports. When coding this meeting phase, indicate the approximate share of time (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) that the board was listening to a presentation or report and the remaining share that the board was discussing or debating. For example, if the board listened to a presentation half the time and asked questions half the time, this would be coded as 50% listening and 50% engaging. If a board member is the one giving the presentation or report and the other board members are silently listening, this would qualify as "listening."</p>
        <p class="phaseDef"><span id="opening-closing" class="defTitle">Opening / Closing</span><br/>
        The opening includes the call to order, attendance roll call, establishment of quorum, pledge of allegiance, reading of district mission statement, or any other non-substantive ritual that is repeated at the beginning of every meeting. The closing takes place at the end of the meeting after all of the agendized items have been covered. It may include a period of announcements from individual board members, consideration of a motion to adjourn or adjourn to a closed session, or something similar. This may also include transitions to and from recess or to and from closed session.</p>
